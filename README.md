A simple tool to add classifications to your IFC models üõ†Ô∏è

## üéØ The Problem

Working with IFC files? Then you know how hard it can be to get everyone to consistently classify model elements. Whether you're using Uniclass, eBKP-H, or your own system, getting teams to properly implement `IfcClassificationReference` is often a pain.

After initially thinking about how to fully automating this process, I quickly realized that regulations, responsibilities across disciplines, and accountability requirements make that approach less practical.

## ‚ú® What This Tool Does

IFC Classifier helps you classify IFC elements without needing expert knowledge of BIM authoring tools. It's designed to make the process simpler and more repeatable.

**Note:** This is a **Work In Progress** and open source under the **AGPL v3** license.

## üåü Features

- **üñºÔ∏è IFC Viewer:**

  - View IFC models in your browser
  - Standard navigation (orbit, pan, zoom)
  - Easy model exploration through spatial tree
  - Check element properties
  - Hide/show elements as needed

- **üìö Classification Systems:**

  - Use ready-made systems:
    - üá®üá≠ Swiss CRB eBKP-H
    - üá¨üáß Uniclass
  - Or create your own custom system
  - Assign colors to visualize different classifications

- **‚öôÔ∏è Rule-Based Sorting:**

  - Create rules to automatically sort elements
  - Based on properties like: `IsExternal`, `LoadBearing`, etc.
  - Example: "Put all external, non-load bearing walls (except basement) into category C02.01"
  - See rule results live on your model
  - Import rules from JSON or Excel for easy setup
  - Export rules to JSON or Excel for sharing

- **‚úçÔ∏è Export Your Work:**

  - Save your model with proper `IfcClassificationReference` entities
  - Use the improved file in other BIM tools

- **üîÆ Coming Soon:**
  - Support for property-based classification (where codes are stored in Psets instead of IfcClassificationReference)

## üöÄ Recent Updates

**May 20, 2025:**
